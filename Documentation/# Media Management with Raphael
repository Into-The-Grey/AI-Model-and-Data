# Media Management with Raphael

## Objective

Develop Raphael's capabilities to sort and manage image and media files, including detecting and removing duplicates.

## Media Sorting

- **Categorization**: Sort images and media based on metadata like creation date, format, or source.
- **Content Analysis**: Use image recognition to categorize media based on content (e.g., landscapes, portraits).

## Duplicate Detection and Removal

- **Detection Algorithm**: Implement algorithms to identify duplicate files based on content, metadata, or file hashes.
- **Automated Cleanup**: Develop a system for safe removal of duplicates, with user confirmation steps.

## Considerations

- **Accuracy**: Prioritize accurate detection to avoid loss of important data.
- **User Control**: Allow user oversight and final decision-making in duplicate removal.

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate AI-based content recognition for advanced media sorting.
- Explore options for automated backup before deletion of duplicates.
